a few extra setup steps:
- GodotXUnitApi requires xunit package
- GodotXUnitApi requires the `xunit.runner.utility` package
- the main project will need to include `addons/GodotXUnit/GodotTestRunner.cs`
  - if someone knows how to use a node from another project, let me know.
    i keep getting an error saying it cant be found.
- the main project should reference GodotXUnitApi project
- the main project will require the `xunit` package
